    <p>Utah has a unique set of challenges when it comes to motor vehicle accidents. 
    Lawmakers need to understand these unique challenges better in order to regulate effectively.</p>

    <p>This data set is from The Crash Studies Team at UDOT's Traffic & Safety Division maintains a detailed 
    database of all crashes on public roadways in Utah. The data is used to report safety trends, identify 
    potential safety improvement projects, and allocate limited funding to projects that will have the greatest 
    impact on safety. This data and all UDOT Safety Program information are protected under 23 USC 409 and therefore inadmissible in court.</p>

    <p>This site allows users to view the database while providing additional features for filtering and identifying trends.
    Something about a model being included to predict the severity of a potential crash based on several features.</p>
